# Psycle

A system to make your bicycle smarter, safer, and more secure. The Psycle brings your bicycle into the 21st century
by combining an Android application for smartphones with a multitude of sensors powered by an Arduino and the Intel
Edison board. It provides turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps without the need to look at a phone through
vibrating motors on each handlebar and also controls turn signalling via Bluetooth communication. A basic anti-theft system is in place as well as an LED screen which displays vital information for cyclists.

All Arduino code can be found under the Smart_bike_main folder. The Android application can be found in the SmartBike
folder. LED screen support for the Intel Edison can be found inside the oled folder.
